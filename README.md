This readme file contains useless information for your entertainment.

Game originally produced for Yogscast Game Jam 2020.
## Game Description
Fishing Trip is a fishing simulator where you catch fish through a minigame and sell them to buy better fishing rods and access to the next areas.
## Backstory
>As a child, I often followed my grandfather, who made his living as a fisherman. We would go on trips to all sorts of places until that fateful day.
As he battled with that terrible beast on those stormy waters, he was pulled overboard in an instant and I never saw him again. I avoided the waters for many years after that, but something calls me back, and I make a fishing pole out of a simple stick and line I procured.
## Gameplay
How to play: Click anywhere on screen to cast line, the actual line casted will have a slightly random position. When a fish bites, mash on them until their stamina depletes to catch them. Access shop on top left corner, save up funds to purchase better fishing rods and reach new areas. Different fish have different stats, and they yield different amounts of money. You won't know what you get until you reel it in (surprise!).
## Features
The game consists of five different stages, from a pond to an ocean, where the player can catch from a wide selection of 20 different species of fish.
## System requirements
Not a potato PC
