### Game Description
Fishing Trip is a fishing simulator where you catch fish through a minigame and sell them to buy better fishing rods and access to the next areas.
### Backstory
>As a child, I often followed my grandfather, who made his living as a fisherman. We would go on trips to all sorts of places until that fateful day.
As he battled with that terrible beast on those stormy waters, he was pulled overboard in an instant and I never saw him again. I avoided the waters for many years after that, but something calls me back, and I make a fishing pole out of a simple stick and line I procured.
